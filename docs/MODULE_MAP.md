# Module map

One row per module. Use this to find the owner of a concept before reading any
code.

## Shared kernel

| Path | Contents | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shared/lib/money.ts` | `Money`, arithmetic, formatting | Integer cents; `money()` rejects non-integers |
| `shared/lib/dates.ts` | `IsoDate` arithmetic and formatting | UTC only |
| `shared/lib/errors.ts` | `AppError` taxonomy | Thrown by services, mapped by `server/http` |
| `shared/lib/result.ts` | `Result<T,E>`, `Available<T>` | `Available` enforces BR-04 |
| `shared/lib/money.ts` → `allocateMoney` | Largest-remainder split | Enforces BR-06 rounding at allocation boundaries |
| `shared/types/amounts.ts` | `AmountBasis`, `DatedEntry` | BR-06: actual/forecast/estimated; effective vs posted date |
| `modules/access/permissions.ts` | `Capability`, `AccessScope` | NFR-01: deny by default |
| `shared/types/common.ts` | Branded ids, `Provenance`, `Tone` | No module imports allowed here |
| `shared/config/app-config.ts` | As-of date, currency, thresholds | `STALE_VALUATION_MONTHS`, `UPCOMING_WINDOW_DAYS` |
| `shared/config/navigation.ts` | Nav model | Drives sidebar, tab bar, page titles |
| `shared/components/` | Design-system primitives | See below |
| `shared/shell/` | `AppShell`, `Sidebar`, `TopBar`, `TabBar`, `Scrim`, toast + nav context | |

## Shared components

| Component | Design class | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Icon` / `IconSprite` | `svg.i` | 25 symbols, ported verbatim |
| `Chip` | `.chip` | Status — always icon + words (NFR-07) |
| `Card` / `CardHeader` / `CardBody` | `.card` | Surface container |
| `Kpi` / `KpiGrid` / `Delta` | `.kpi` | Metric tiles; one `accent` hero per screen |
| `DataTable` | `table.stack-m` | Collapses to label/value cards ≤840px; optional keyboard-accessible row click |
| `FilterGroup` | `.filter` | Pill filters with `aria-pressed` |
| `Banner` | `.banner` | Inline warn/info notice |
| `Timeline` | `.tl` | Reminder schedules, audit log |
| `Stepper` | `.stepper` | Import wizard progress |
| `Confidence` | `.conf` | Match confidence bar — marks suggestions as suggestions |
| `Avatar` / `OwnerTag` | `.avatar`, `.owner` | People; dashed variant for unassigned |
| `List` / `ListRow` / `DateBox` | `.list`, `.date-box` | Dated list rows |
| `Tabs` | `.tabs` | Underlined tab strip |
| `TextField` / `SelectField` / `FieldGrid` | `.field`, `.fgrid` | Forms with hint and error states |
| `Stack` / `Row` / `Grid` / `Stat` / `Sub` | `.stack`, `.row`, `.grid` | Layout primitives |

## Server infrastructure

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `server/db/collection.ts` | The single data-access seam. Swap this to change persistence. |
| `server/http/respond.ts` | Response envelope; the only file mapping errors to status codes |
| `server/http/route.ts` | `handle()`, `parseBody()`, `parseQuery()` |

## Adding to the map

A new module belongs here the moment it exists. If two modules both want to own a
concept, one of them is wrong — decide which, and record the decision in
`PROJECT_MEMORY.md`.
